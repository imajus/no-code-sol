      <p class="lead">Visual sequential workflow design tool for building Solidity Smart Contracts with no actual
        Solidity syntax knowledge required.</p>
      <hr class="my-4">
      <p>The tool is great for prototyping ideas because of low initial learning curve and general convenience of
        ready-to-use web based solution. The additional steps like setting up a local development environment and
        deployment infrastructure are essentially put aside. </p>
      <p>You could just open a web page, design a desired Smart Contract logic and then export the result in a
        form of Solidity/ABI/AST/Bytecode files or deploy to EVM compatible blockchain directly from the browser.</p>
      <p>The proof-of-concept implementation allows to create Smart Contracts with multiple functions and custom logic
        involving a (yet) limited set of operations.</p>
